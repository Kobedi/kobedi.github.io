        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
				You might have guessed it, I am just an ordinary data science enthusiast, passionate about the kinds of analytic and intelligent conclusions data provide. 
				I have been in IT since 2006 and worked as java developer. I worked from different business industried, ranging from supply chain, road accident insurance, health insurence and the banking sector. I am a Solutions Architectures working for one of the top insurance companies ins South Africa. 
				I am married to a very supportive wife and blessed with two beautiful girls, so yeah you can imagine it, I know my ways around girls. I also enjoy writing white papers around data science and teaching basic data science concepts. Away from data science, I love travelling, especially unplanned long distrance trips. South Africa has some much nature scenary to offer, so I constantly have some where to go and explore. Below are some of the platforms you can reach me on.
